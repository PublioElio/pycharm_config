# Python Challenges

## Challenge 1

The purpose of the `sum_num` method is to calculate the sum of three numbers 
(a, b, c). However, it has a special condition: if all three numbers are equal, 
the result is doubled.

## Challenge 2

The `sqrt` function calculates the square root of a given number num using an iterative
approximation method called the Babylonian Method (or Heron's method).
It refines the estimation of the square root until the result is sufficiently close to the true value.

## Challenge 3
